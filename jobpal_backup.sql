We are working to refine and scale our existing features and add others to solidify our advantage in the space. There will be an exciting mix of building new features and improving existing features to work well at scale and account for different variations in user needs.  \n  \nFrom a product perspective, we have a unique challenge in building our student-facing products like consumer products. We prioritize ease of use and delight and try to drive organic adoption. On the school district-facing side, we have highly robust workflow tools, analytics, permission management, and configuration that rival modern enterprise tools, even those outside the education space. You will be responsible for both sides of the coin regarding the features you manage.  \n  \nAbout the role  \n  \nSchooLinks is looking for a Product Manager for one of our pods that maintains different parts of our platform. You’ll be responsible for a portfolio of products across the platform. This pod is fully built with engineering managers, engineers, QA, and design. We're looking for a Product Manager who can come in to understand the problem space and continue to iterate in the problem space we're working on, either by extending and iterating on our existing solutions or proposing and building new products.  \n  \nWhile we do not differentiate between technical and "regular" product managers, or product owners on our team, our most successful product managers are highly technical and deal with API products and data integrations using education data standards such as OneRoster and Ed-Fi.  \n  \n**Day-to-day responsibilities:**  \nProject management to enable the team to execute quickly and efficiently, breaking down epics and stories, tracking engineering progress, and ensuring deliverables and timelines are met.  \nSuggestion and bug triage from our users and backlog ownership, quickly moving issues through the process and ensuring we resolve issues quickly and clearly communicate back to stakeholders.  \nCommunicate business needs and requirements to your engineering team to create excitement and buy-in.  \nProduct vision - figuring out what the pod will invest time in to meet the needs of our student users and staff users and to align that work with the leadership's vision for the growth of the company  \nMaking tactical calls about how to build specific features and what is worth the investment vs. what is not.  \nOwn the day-to-day team rituals, including standups, grooming, retro, and handoffs.  \nWork with district stakeholders to collect requirements and identify opportunities.  \nRelease management and release notes, along with maintaining documentation for your modules.  \nCommunication with other departments about the work your pod is doing: customer success, marketing, and sales  \nSupport the implementation and sales processes by acting as the SME for your team's products.  \nYou will not be the QA tester for the pod, but you must own the outcome of the products your team ships.  \n  \n**How you'll know if you will be successful:**  \nDriving an increase in the utilization rate of your products.  \nPositive customer feedback and advocacy to help us grow faster.  \nEffectively managing the lifecycle, including making the right decisions on what to build, when to build it, and when it is ready for release.  \n  \n**Your first 30 Days:**  \nYou are getting your footing and learning the problem space.
